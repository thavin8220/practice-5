	  Pulsar is one of the earliest perfo
	  rmance-oriented motorcycles built in India. With a legacy of nearly two decades, the Pulsars have always been about 
	  extracting maximum thrills from each and every ride. The smallest Pulsar that is now on sale is the<u> Pulsar 125,</u>
	  prices now starting from <mark>Rs 69,997.</mark> The top of the line Pulsar is the Pulsar RS200,<mark> now costing Rs 1.45 lakh.</mark> All prices, ex-showroom Delhi.</li> <br>
	  <li>This
	  typical Pulsar still looks fresh and new buyers 
	  are many times pulled away from the NS200 as the looks of 220F are actually considered
	  better. Since Bajaj has been updating the shades from time to time, Pulsar 220F finds no drawbacks when seen from an everyday riderâ€™s point of view.</li><br>
	 <li> The engine is a tried and tested unit, loaded with such power that a slight hold on the clutch and sudden acceleration can make a wheelie in even the second gear.
	  The exhaust note is actually better than most recent launched bikes from other brands.</li></b>
